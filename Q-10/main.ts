// Q-10 Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written,
//  and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything
//   specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point,
//    just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file.
//     Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

// this program adds two numbers and print the result

//Define two numbers\

let number1: number = 5;
let number2: number = 6;

//add two numbers
let result: number = number1 + number2;
//print result
console.log (result);
