// Q-20 Think of something you could store in a array. 
// For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, 
// or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
var countries = ["Canada", "Turki", "China", "France", "German"];
//print list of countries
console.log("list of countries", countries.forEach(function (country) {
    console.log(country);
}));
