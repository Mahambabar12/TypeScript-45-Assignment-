QUESTION # 32

Checking Usernames: Do the following to create a program that simulates
 how websites ensure that everyone has a unique username.
• Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.

• Make another list of five usernames called new_users. 
Make sure one or two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.

• Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been used. If it has, 
print a message that the person will need to enter a new username. If a username has not been used, 
print a message saying that the username is available.

• Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has been used, 'JOHN' should not be accepted.*/



let current_user = ["Maham", "Hani", "Fatima", "Esha", "Maheen", "Kiran"];

let new_user = ["Ali", "parisa", "Hina", "usama", "Babar"];

//we will use forEach method
new_user.forEach(new_user => {
    let new_userLower = new_user.toLowerCase();

 //we will use some() method
 let userNameTaken = current_user.some(current_user => current_user.
    toLocaleLowerCase() === new_userLower);   //true or false

    //new we will apply conditions
    if(userNameTaken){
        console.log(`${new_user} needs to choose a new username because it's
        already taken`);
    }else{
        console.log(`${new_user} is the new member added`);
        current_user.push(new_user)      //add new user to current users array

    }
});

console.log(current_user);
