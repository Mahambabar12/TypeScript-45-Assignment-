QUESTION # 38

Cities: Write a function called describe_city() that accepts the name of a city and its country.
The function should print a simple sentence, such as Karachi is in Pakistan.
Give the parameter for the country a default value. Call your function for three different cities,
at least one of which is not in the default country.*/
//function called describe_city()
function describeCity(city, country) {
    if (country === void 0) { country = 'Unknown'; }
    console.log("".concat(city, " is in ").concat(country, "."));
}
// Calling describe city() for three different cities.
describeCity('jeddah', 'saudia arab');
describeCity('ontorio', 'canada');
describeCity('austria'); // Country defaults to 'Unknown'
